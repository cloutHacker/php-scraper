# php scraper
## Capabilities
**This is a native php scraper that can scrape all sites you wish.**
</br>
*It can scrape using filter tags and also take also attributes for example in the sample code it scraped all the images in jumia.*
</br>
<img alt="jumia image" src="https://github.com/cloutHacker/projectImages/blob/master/scraper/scraper.png" height="500">
</br>
This helps you in many projects such as url extractor for youtube and other sample projects.
This project uses eloquent methods alot making it easy to run code and save time.
The preview I have given is for scraping Jumia, but this project can be used for any other purposes.Soon I will be releasing one of nodejs so stay tune to my account.
